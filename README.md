# Speaker-Recognition
Arduino code for the Speaker Recognition project.
There are two files in this project. The first one, Client.ino is to program the Arduino Nano to collect the voice samples.
The second one, host.ino is for the Arduino Uno R3 to do the main operations. 
The paper following this project will be updated after the conference's notification of acceptance/rejection.
